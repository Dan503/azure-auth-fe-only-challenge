# Azure auth challenge

Publicly accessible website:

## Challenge:

Create an FE only authentication using the [MSAL JS Auth library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msal)

Use an Azure Authentication token to handle the authorization.

## Why Vite?

Vite has no built in server-side functionality so I knew that I wouldn't accidentally introduce any server-side stuff with it.

It is also extremely performant.
